The same URL format is used, omitting\r\nthe hostname, and using the \"file\" portion as the filename of the database.\r\nThis has the effect of four slashes being present for an absolute file path:\r\n`sqlite:////full/path/to/your/database/file.sqlite`.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    $ pip install pw-database-url\r\n"}
